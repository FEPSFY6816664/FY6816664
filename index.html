                        This article delves into the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, drawing inspiration from
                        quantum mechanics for procedural content generation. Utilizing the concept of superposition,
                        each map cell is considered a superposition of potential tiles, with entropy guiding collapsed
                        states. Constraints, like Sudoku rules, establish interdependencies. The algorithm initializes
                        in an unobserved state, mirroring quantum principles, collapsing cells into singular values.
                        When applied to map generation, the WFC algorithm manipulates tile sets to craft seamless
                        landscapes by eliminating incompatible possibilities. Despite a time, complexity drawback, its
                        reliability proves valuable for game designers in procedural content generation. The WFC
                        algorithm emerges as a versatile and powerful tool in creative procedural content generation for
                        game design, showing malleability and efficiency across varying scenarios, from character
                        textures to entire maps.

                In this article I would like to adventure through the process and uses of the wave function collapse
                algorithm. The way it works is seemingly simple yet inspired by quantum mechanics and the idea that one
                object can exist in multiple states simultaneously, will bring forward the true strength of the method.

                “Superposition is something that happens in quantum mechanics which … means that this map currently
                exists as every possible map imaginable from the randomly assembled maps all the way to the seamless
                cohesive maps” – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe_7b9pRKY8">Jabrils (2020)</a> Minecraft, But
                On a Quantum Computer. 17 Oct 2020. (Accessed: 27 Nov 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
                Jabrils perfectly summarises the idea that a superposition allows every state to exist simultaneously.
                We use this idea to allow every cell in the map to exist as every tile and pick and choose the tiles we
                either don’t want to allow to exist or tiles that we do. The number of possible values that we give a
                cell we can call the entropy of the cell. This will be useful to determine which cells have collapsed to
                one value, by simply looking at the cell’s entropy. The way that we can make the cells dependent on each
                other is by using constraints. Constraints can be described using a sudoku for example, a sudoku has
                rules, these rules help us infer the value of a cell by what matches the rules. In sudoku you cannot
                have the same value in the same “row”, “column” or “box”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In mxgmn’s github repository, after preparing the tile set we are told to “Initialize the wave in the
                completely unobserved state” – <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse#algorithm">maxum
                    gumin (2023)</a>. this is a more ‘quantum
                mechanics’ oriented way to say we want to see the empty cells as merely unset truth. According to our
                knowledge of superpositions, an empty sudoku board exists as every permutation of the sudoku, both
                correct and incorrect complete boards. With a mini sudoku there are 4^16 possible boards and only 288
                that are correct.

            <p>
                By finding the correct values for the cell, we must collapse a cell to a single value, “the idea of
                collapse in the context of entropy is to collapse all the possible states down into one, remove all the
                entropy from a single variable of the system” –- <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM&t=241s">the coding train (2022)</a>. , this is
                simply done by picking a cell
                and determining its value from one of its possibilities. Great, so now we have a sudoku with one value,
                how does this help? Well, we now must apply our constraints. As we know our rules dictate that we cannot
                allow the same value to exist in the same “row”, “column” or “box”. Hence, we remove any ‘bad’
                possibilities from any cells that are affected. This reduces the entropy of the cells in the same “row”,
                “column”, or “box” from 4 to 3 because we have removed one value from all those cells. We have also
                managed to reduce the number of possibilities to 4^15. Next, if we collapse a cell of lowest entropy
                (greater than 1) then we can repeat this process until we have a result that is a complete sudoku! The
                process can be represented by the flowchart in the figure below.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/flowchart.png" alt="figure 2">
            <p>
                So, how does this help us with our map generation? Well, we now have the algorithm that we want to
                follow to approach a result that we want. Let’s start with our tiles. Our set of tiles we will use for
                this example uses 4 different tiles, as shown below. As you can see, all of the tile’s edges will
                have one of 2 kinds of edges, either road or grass. This allows us to define the constraints we need. We
                only want edges that match to be kept as a possibility to make this a seamless map. So, when we collapse
                a cell in this case, we will remove any possibility of a non-matching neighbour cell, leaving only
                seamless possible tiles, letting us then collapse those cells and repeat!
            </p>
            <img src="assets/tiles.png" alt="figure 3">
            <img src="assets/seamlessmap.png" alt="figure 4">
            <p>
                However, there is one downside. It’s the algorithms time complexity, without optimisation, the algorithm
                takes exponentially longer to complete with more tiles and larger dimensions. The big O notation for
                this is O(hwn) where h = height, w = width and n is the number of tiles. This is due to having to loop
                through every cell on the grid and loop through every tile to see which tiles are possible for each of
                the neighbouring cell’s possibilities. As you can see the amount of looping makes the processing time
                extremely long relative to other procedurally generated terrain methods. However, with optimisations
                such as memoization, we a can store the result for repeated calculations with the same parameters.

                Nevertheless, the method itself is robust and reliable. “We propose a PCG (procedural content
                generation) generation method that is friendly to game designers by introducing a WFC (wave function
                collapse) technique that is widely used in texture synthesis.” -- <a

                    KIM, Shinjin KANG (2020)</a> Despite its speed, it can be extremely useful for game designers to use
                in a wide variety of
                ways, from making textures for characters on the spot to vary design yet maintain style to generating
                entire maps that can be fabricated in the background.
